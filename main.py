"""
Main entry point for the Ski! 3D Alpine Ski Terrain Rendering System.

This is a placeholder main file that can be used to launch different components
of the ski terrain rendering system. Currently minimal - the main functionality
is distributed across:

- Web-based 3D renderer: Launch via `python server.py` and open index.html
- MCP elevation server: Launch via `python run_elevation_server.py`
- Individual MCP agents: Located in mcp/ directory

Usage:
    python main.py          # Shows basic project info
    python server.py        # Start HTTP server for 3D terrain renderer
    python run_elevation_server.py  # Start MCP elevation data server

For development and testing, see README.md for detailed instructions.
